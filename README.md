# Design Project 1: Acceleration Data Analysis

**Course:** ENGR 16200  
**Section:** 3  
**Team:** 41

## Description

A brief script to get and plot acceleration data.

A MATLAB program that analyzes acceleration data from an Excel file. The program reads X, Y, and Z acceleration components, computes the total magnitude, and visualizes the results.

## Team Members

- Advay R Chandra (chand289)
- Sarim Khan (khan681)
- Emma C Wolcott (ewolcott)
- Katherine E Hughley (khughle)

## Usage

1. Place your acceleration data in `Data.xlsx`
2. Run `analysis.m` in MATLAB

## Output

The program generates a plot showing:
- Total magnitude of acceleration
- X, Y, and Z acceleration components

Results are saved in the `Results/` folder.
